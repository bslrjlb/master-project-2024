1. 重要性和敏感性分析(定性)：首先评估每个条件独立性在因果图中的重要性。
   一些条件独立性可能对验证整体结构更为关键。通过进行敏感性分析，识别哪些条件独立性对模型预测的影响最大。

2. 先验知识：利用现有的先验知识或文献中已经被广泛接受的因果关系来指导您的选择。
   如果某些条件独立性已经被其他研究验证，您可能不需要重复测试。

3. 简化因果图：尝试简化您的因果图模型，移除那些不太可能影响最终结论的边和节点，这样可以减少需要测试的条件独立性的数量。

4. 分阶段测试：将测试分为几个阶段，先从那些最有可能证明或反驳您假设的条件独立性开始。
   根据初步结果调整您的假设和测试计划。

5. 采用计算方法(定量)：使用计算模型和算法（如贝叶斯网络、因果发现算法等）来评估哪些条件独立性最关键。
   这些方法可以帮助识别因果图中的关键结构和最有信息量的测试。







This is the correct graph. Think carefully about the hypothesis you want to test:

Emission -> unobserved mediators (e.g., choice of traders) -> return (t+1)

versus

Emission [no link]  unobserved mediators (e.g., choice of traders) -> return (t+1)
